# Running the generator
The following files serve for starting the graph generator.

- 'ldcrgen.bat' is a batch script for Windows. 
	Try calling 'ldcrgen.bat -h' for help.

- 'ldcrgen.jar' is the generator itself. 
	Try calling 'java -jar ldcrgen -h' for help.

- 'ldcrgen.sh' is a bash script for Unixes. 
	Try calling 'ldcrgen.sh -h' for help.

- 'version.txt' contains the exact revision of the files and may be 
	useful for debugging.

The command-line help (available via option -h/--help) can also be found under resources/help.txt.
